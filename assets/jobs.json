Happy to walk through this on our call together today (I asked for more feedback internally but have not heard back):\nWould be nice to have some candidates in UAE/Dubai, as everyone was currently located outside of UAE. We're open to outside the UAE but would prefer someone local as they are typically better English speakers and more familiar with , is this possible?\nI think overall we need more technical background and experience with candidates, meaning use/experience with Google Tag Manager, Tag Management Systems (Tealium, BrightTag), pixel/tag implementation, and rolling out tracking tags on sites and mobile applications. \nWe do not just need an analyst that has used GA, we need a technical implementation specialist or marketing engineer or technical marketer etc.\nWeb development and basic javascript experience is useful too, again to point #2 and #3 above. We don't need just an analyst, but more someone to implement tracking on websites and apps technically. So anyone handling tag or pixel deployment.\nCandidates like this are great:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/sajakhtar\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-haentjens-025b1460\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/louayfakhoury","submitted":"2016-06-05T14:27:33.051Z","__v":9,"paid":"2016-06-12T13:41:20.515Z","launched":true,"launchedAt":"2016-06-13T11:32:05.767Z","syncedWith":{"id":"4292b","title":"Web Analyst - Info Trust - Dubai","full_title":"Web Analyst - Info Trust - Dubai - Dubai","shortcode":"43B2204048","code":null,"state":"published","department":"Live","url":"https://visage.workable.com/jobs/271449","application_url":"https://visage.workable.com/jobs/271449/candidates/new","shortlink":"https://visage.workable.com/j/43B2204048","location":{"country":"United Arab Emirates","country_code":"AE","region":"Dubai","region_code":"DU","city":"Dubai","zip_code":null,"telecommuting":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T10:12:16Z","fromNow":"a month","selected":true},"sourcing":true,"requirementsUpdates":[],"requirements":{"resLocation":"Dubai is first option, UAE 2nd, Anywhere 3rd","gender":"Any","nationality":"Any","language":"English, arabic a plus","jobTitle":"Web analytics consultant, technical implementation specialist, marketing engineer, technical marketer","yearsExp":"at least 1 year in web analytics or technical consulting with experience with Google Tag Manager, Tag Management Systems (Tealium, BrightTag), pixel/tag implementation, and rolling out tracking tags on sites and mobile applications","employer":"Google or any  Google Analytics Certified Partner Companies in the region (GACP) ideally","workExp":"technical background and experience, CPG, FMCG, publishing - Salesforce is a plus","location":"Any","salary":"up to $4200 a month, flexible depending on experience, includes: health cover, flexible working hours, flexible vacation days, annual trip to home country","major":"Computer science and/or Marketing ideal","candidateDescription":"Looking for a Web analytics consultant with at least one year experience, ideally at a Google Analytics certified partner, who can support and advise clients on their digital strategies","skills":["google analytics","Google Tag Manager","Web Analytics","BrightTag","Tealium","technical implementation"]},"shortlist":{"createdAt":"2016-06-13T12:02:22.312Z","lastUpdateAt":"2016-06-20T09:17:55.754Z"},"submissions":["575ea0cfd47a4001001df86b","575ea25bd47a4001001df86e","575ea44cd47a4001001df871","575ea648d47a4001001df874","575ea778d47a4001001df877","5766528ed47a4001001df90c","5766670bd47a4001001df921","5767a402d47a4001001df95b","5767a517d47a4001001df95e","5767a5e9d47a4001001df961"],"assignments":["577d031ea1ed7b01005101cc","577d08baa1ed7b01005101f1","577d0cd3a1ed7b0100510205","577d10a2a1ed7b010051020f","577d225ca1ed7b0100510225","577e0a037b984601001df823","577fcd3ebe052d0100f12c54","5781568fd9bba70100468375"],"sourceId":"","source":"https://bo.visage.jobs","salaryRange":"$4,000 - $5,000","employmentType":"Employee","industry":"Advertising","city":"Dubai","role":"Technology/IT"},{"_id":"57663be6d47a4001001df8f8","employmentStatus":"Full Time","employer_id":"YXV0aDB8NTc2NjM2NzZiMmQ3ZWI5MzY4MmU4Mjk1","status":"ShortlistReady","title":"Digital Planning Manager/ Associate Director","location":"United Arab Emirates","description":"We are recruiting for a Digital Planning Manager/Associate director ( someone with at least 7 years experience in pure digital planning/operations.
